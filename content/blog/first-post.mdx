## Introduction

Web performance is no longer just about minifying JavaScript. With **Next.js 16** and **React 19**, we have moved towards a model where the server does the heavy lifting.

### Key Concepts

1. Server Components
2. Streaming HTML
3. Asset Optimization

This architecture allows us to ship less JavaScript to the client, resulting in faster Time to Interactive (TTI).
